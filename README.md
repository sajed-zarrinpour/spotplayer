    namespace App\Http\Controllers;
    
    use Illuminate\Http\Request;
    
    use SajedZarinpour\Spotplayer\Facades\SpotPlayer;
    
    class SpotPlayerController extends Controller
    {
        
        public function play(Request $request)
        {
           ...
           SpotPlayer::some_func();
           ...
        }
    }

and

    <?php
    
    namespace App\Http\Controllers;
    
    use Illuminate\Http\Request;
    
    use SajedZarinpour\Spotplayer\Facades\SpotPlayer;
    
    class SpotPlayerController extends Controller
    {
        
        public function play(Request $request)
        {
             ...
             spotplayer()->some_func();
             ...
        }
    }
    

Note the import when using the Facade.

> ```
>     php artisan serve --host=localhost
> ```
> Otherwise **the cookie won't set**.
